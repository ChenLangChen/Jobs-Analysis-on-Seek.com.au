# Summary
As a recent graudate struggling in the job market, I decided to make my job hunting experience a bit easier through analysis on the data scraped from https://www.seek.com.au/ within the last 3 months (2020-10 to 2021-01). The data set I collected contains over 80,000 job listings across 29 industries.
In this project, we're going to look at the following features of the job market in Australia over the last 3 months.
- Buzzwords in each industry 
- Industries that emphasizes certain soft skills, such as teamwork, communication skills and experience.
- Given a list of skills, find the 5 best matched job listings.
- Visualizing the job description of different positions of an industry in 2D
- Top hiring companies in an industry
- Most popular jobs in each industry 
- Cities with high demand in an industry

## Buzzwords in an industry 
[Reference Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/natural-language-processing-feature-engineering-using-tf-idf-e8b9d00e7e76)

- This section aims at finding the keywords of a given industry and plotting a word cloud. 
- Instead of ranking the importance of a word simply based on its Term Frequency (TF) within the document. We look at the **TF-IDF** value of a word.
- **TF**: The number of times a word appears in a document divided by the total number of words in the document.
- **IDF**: The log of the number of documents divided by the number of documents that contain the word w. Rare words have high IDF, and stop words have low IDF.
- TF-IDF = TF * IDF 
- Why TF-IDF?  
**TF-IDF** quantifies the importance of a word in the document. We want words that occur frequently only in the industry we're investigating, but not in other industries. If we simply use TF, some stop words such as 'the', 'of' may be the most occurring words, but not representative of the industry. IDF for stop words are small, which prevents their TF-IDF from getting big.  
```python
def TF_IDF(documentA, documentB):
    # documentA is a signle doc, documentB is a list of docs, the more the better
    my_list = [documentA, *documentB]
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(my_list)
    feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names()
    dense = vectors.todense()
    denselist = dense.tolist()
    df = pd.DataFrame(denselist, columns=feature_names)
    return df
```
### Example A: Keywords in 'Information & Communication Technology'
![alt](screenshots/IT_keywords.png)

#### Observation
The word cloud shows that buzzwords in the IT industry are 'data','experience', 'business', 'cloud', etc.

### Example B: Keywords in 'Hospitality & Tourism'
![alt](screenshots/tourism_wordcloud.png)

#### Observation
The word cloud shows that buzzwords in Hospitality & Tourism are 'restaurant','food', 'kitchen', 'chef', 'hotel' etc.

## Industries that emphasize soft skills most, such as teamwork, communication skills and experience.
This is done through making use of the keywords in all 29 industries we extracted from the previous section. Unfortunately, due to the limitation of computation resources, I wasn't able to extract the keywords including multi-grams such as 'communication skills' as one word. 
After going though the keywords extracted, I picked the most representative words for soft skills or qualification. 
```python
picked_words = ['team', 'experience', 'skill', 'service','customer','ability','people',
                'client','management','customer','safety',
                'business','client']
``` 
### Example A: Industries that emphasize 'management'
![alt](screenshots/management_industry.png)
#### Observation
The bar chart shows that 'Real Estate & Property', 'Construction' and 'CEO & General Management' emphasizes management skills a lot.
### Example B: Industries that emphasize 'service'
![alt](screenshots/service_industry.png)
The bar chart shows that good service is highly emphasized in 'Call Centre & Customer Service', 'Community Services & Development' and 'Information & Communication Technology'. 

## Given a list of skills, find the 5 best matched job listings.
* This is particularly useful, when searching for jobs, you don't want to spend time going through all job listings one by one. ðŸ˜Ž 
* Based on your skill set, it returns the 5 best matched latest job postings. 
It returns the ID of the job listings, so that we can search the job listing by URL, e.g. 'https://www.seek.com.au/job/51386461'

```python 
def match_my_skills(industry, my_skills):
    IT_df = select_industry(industry)
    train_corpus = IT_df['job_description'].tolist()
    bigram = get_bigram(train_corpus)
    
    return match_jobs (IT_df, my_skills) 
```
### Scenario: Alexa is looking for work in IT, and she is familiar wth Node, RxJS, Javascript and angular.
```python
my_skills = ['Node','RxJS','Javascript','angular']
matched_jobIDs = match_my_skills("Information & Communication Technology", my_skills)
```

## Visualizing the job description of different positions in 2D
 - By visualising the job description within one industry, we can understand how different job positions within the same industry overlap with or differ from each other. It allows more flexibility for us when looking for jobs, so that we don't have to be restricted to one or 2 job categories. 

How to do it?
- We convert job description as text to vector using Doc2Vec algorithm, an NLP tool for representing documents as a vector. 
- Reduce the dimension of the vector to 2D for visualisation with TSNE algorithm, a tool to map multi-dimensional data to 2 or more dimensions suitable for human observation.
### Example A: Visualising different job positions within 'Farming, Animals & Conservation'
<img align="center" width="700" height="450" src="screenshots/farming_jobs.png">

#### Observation:
The bubble chart of 'Farming, Animals & Conservation' shows that jobs in 'Fishing & Aquaculture', 'Horiculture', 'Winery & Viticulture', 'Farm Labor' and 'Farm Management' are similar to each other. On the contrary, 'Agronomy & Farm Services', 'Veterinary Services & Animal Welfare' and 'Conservation, Parks & Wildlife' differ from each other and the other industries.

### Example B: Visualising different job positions within 'Hospitality & Tourism'
